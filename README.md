# RecursiveObjectStorageUpload
This uses Python to upload a folder's contents &amp; its subdirectories' contents to GCP Storage. 

# Your service account will need the appriopriate role to use this application. 

This app seeks to emulate:

```
gsutil cp -r /desktop/folder/ gs://ironmountainn
```

Upload contains the basic code needed. 
cLoUdBACkup is a funnier version.
